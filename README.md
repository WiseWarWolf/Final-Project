Click the link to open the page's website. Then, enter a username and password into the two labeled inputs and then click the register button to add the username and password as credentials to sign in which is what you come up with so make sure you remember what you put. Otherwise, you get an error saying there is no password or username found. Next, either click the sign in and wait the 3 seconds, or reenter the username and password with the assigned logins and then click the sign in button. If you do not have any of the fields populated, it will give you an error and say you need both a password and a username. After waiting 3 seconds, you gain access to the whole website, where you will need to click the load data button and reload the webpage to see the preview log and full log list. After you do that, you can then type your name in and click clock-in to have you name and the current date and time appear in the preview log and full list from most recent to previous. Then you can click the log and calendar nav buttons at the top to go between the 3 different webpages.

This was a lot of fun to make and will really help to making it a app for phones of adding a way to store the data to a database
